# Project - Loan Qualifier App

This project builds a Loan Qualifier App. This app can be used to determine out of a list of 24 lenders, which one will extend loan to a customer based on following information about the customer:
a) Customer's credit score, which represents the customer's creditworthiness based on his or her credit history, including the number of accounts opened, the amount of debt owed, and the repayment history. 
b) Customer's debt-to-income ratio, which compares how much the customer owes to how much the customer earns per month
c) The loan amount requested by the customer
d) Customer's loan-to-value ratio, which compares the amount of loan requested by customer to the appraised value of the asset customer wants to buy.
